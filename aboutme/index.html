        <h2>Mansi Jain</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am a woman who is married to the most amazing husband of all, Vaibhav Jain. I am from Delhi, the capital of India.
           I am an avid reader and a movie watcher. I am not a member of the church. My religion is Jainism. But I respct all religions.</p>
        <p>I am currently a homemaker as well as a student. I am very excited and grateful for the opportunity that BYU-Idaho has 
           provided to me with this online degree programme. I am pursuing Applies Technology BS degree. I have always been curious 
           about the codes that go into making such elaborate websites. So, pursuing this degree would give me a chance to learn more
           about them. </p>
