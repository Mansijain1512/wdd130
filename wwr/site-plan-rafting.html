    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>With this website I want to increase the revenue of my already profitable business. This website would help me 
       promote the concept of river rafting with the potential adventure enthusiasts. I am also going to share information
       about the procedure and the fun facts related to it. I am also going to educate people about the precautions that they 
       need to take during their rafting jouneys. I would even provide the option of online raft bookings on my website.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>My target customers would be the tourists who are going to visit my city in search of recreational activities.
      These are going to be people who are on a vacation and want to have fun. They would be belonging to upper middle 
      income or higher income stratas. They would be between the age group of 12 to 55 years. They could be a family or
      a group of friends or a couple on honeymoon or adventure seekers and sports enthusiasts. My audience is going to 
      access my site through mobile, desktop, and laptop.
